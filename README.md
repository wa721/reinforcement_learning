# reinforcement_learning
My meddling in RL 

This repository contains some hobby scripts for reinforcement learning.

In this repostory, I am attempting to create a series of models which, when given an action space
and an observation space within an environment with defined rewards, can learn any given task. 

The initial example is with the Cart and Pole environment within the OpenAi Gym. As it stands, this
algorithm spends a defined number of episodes within the environement making random decisions before
scaling the observations, clustering them and creating a Q table. This Q table is the basis of the 
learning model. 

I'm not having a lot of luck and so I'm looking out to alternative solutions so if you've received a
random star or fork from me, that's why! 

I welcome forks or any words of advice!
